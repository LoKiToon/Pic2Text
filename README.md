# The Optical Character Recognition Tool

![Alt text](screenshots/app_preview.png)

**This is a Python app that reads text from any source, using optical character recognition. It is a convenient tool. You can open a picture, the camera on your laptop, or any video, and read text from that source. You can then copy the recognised text, so you can keep notes, or send it to someone else. You can also read aloud the recognised text, useful for the blind people.**

## App Dependencies

This app uses several libraries, including external programs that the app uses.

This app utilizes:

- CustomTkinter, for the graphical user interface of the app.
    - CTkMessagebox, to display message to the user.
    - CTkToolTip, to display information when the user hovers on a widget.
    - File dialog from the tkinter library.
- Tesseract, via. pytesseract, for optical character recognition.
- pyttsx3, for text to speech.
- ffmpeg, for splitting video files to frames.
- opencv, for webcam capture, image overlay, and miscellaneous uses.
- pyperclip, for copying the text to the user's clipboard
- Pillow, for miscellaneous uses.
- numpy, for miscellaneous uses.

## Setup ( For Windows )

First, install Python. https://www.python.org/downloads In the installer, choose "Install Now".

Next, install Tesseract. https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki#tesseract-installer-for-windows

In the installer, make sure to set the destination folder to `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`

Then, download ffmpeg. https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/#git-master-builds

Find `ffmpeg-git-full.7z`, then download that file. Make sure to install 7-Zip to open the file.

Once you have opened the file in 7-Zip, extract the folder to `C:\`, and rename the folder to `FFmpeg`.

Then install Git for Windows. Download the latest version. https://git-scm.com/download/win

Next, after Git is installed, open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and run the following commands.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/LoKiToon/OCR-Python-Project
cd OCR-Python-Project
install-dep-win.bat
```

Now you can start the app.

`python OCR-Tool.py`

## Setup ( For Linux )

Make sure you have Git installed. ( If it's not already installed. )

`sudo apt install git`

Open a terminal and type the following commands.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/LoKiToon/OCR-Python-Project
cd OCR-Python-Project
chmod 755 install.sh
./install-dep-linux.sh
```

After the installation is done, you can start the app.

`python3 OCR-Tool.py`

## How To Use This App

2. Webcam Capture - Take a picture from your webcam.
3. Video Frame Extractor - Choose a specific frame from any supported video file.

### Start Detecting Text

Now that you have chosen your image source, you can now start detecting text by clicking the “Start detecting text” button.

After waiting a bit, the text should be recognized, and the app will show you where the text was detected.

Now, you can either copy the recognized text to your clipboard, or have the computer read the text out loud to you.
